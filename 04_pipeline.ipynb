    "1. Video Input: The user uploads a dance video.\n",
    "2. Frame Conversion: This video is converted into a series of static images (frames).\n",
    "3. Pose Extraction: Each frame is analyzed to extract the dancer's pose, generating numerical data about the choreography.\n",
    "4. Data Augmention: Linear algebra concepts are leveraged to add more information about the choreography.\n",
    "5. Data Analysis and Summarization: The augmented data is analyzed to gain insights into the choreography, like body engagement, pose complexity, and range of motion.\n",
    "6. Output: This summary, along with the pose references and insights, is presented to the user and saved for reference.\n"
